- 👋 I'm not usually someone who likes defaults but I'm using default emojis right now. Anyway, you can call me "crazy" or anything really.
- 👀 I like technology, math, science and stuff that relates and revolves around that stuff.
- 🌱 Right now I know nothing about coding, I'll start once I've learned enough. For now I'm a commenter.
- 💞️ I don't want to collaborate. So what should I say to fit the emoji? "I love you!" Except that's not the case I don't know you >:)
- 📫 Contact me @dancinglinenightmemes@gmail.com (1. I hate that name too. 2. Don't contact me.)
